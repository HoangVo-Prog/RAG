# AI Challenge 2025 – Competition Overview

## 📌 Content

-    Contestants will develop intelligent virtual assistant solutions that support in-depth analysis and retrieval of information from large-scale multimedia data (images, audio, text).

-    The competition is organized in the format of a scientific challenge, similar to international competitions aiming to find effective solutions to emerging societal problems.

-    The problem statement for the 2025 Competition is: **Virtual Assistant for querying information from large multimedia databases**, based on the formats of the **Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC)** and **Video Browser Showdown (VBS)**.

## 🧭 Competition Formats

In alignment with global research trends, the AI Challenge 2025 will adopt two formats:

1. **Traditional format**: Participants interact with their team's intelligent virtual assistant to handle multimedia information retrieval queries.

2. **Automated format**: The competition will also pilot an **automated mode**, where virtual assistants compete autonomously.

## 🚀 Encouraged Technologies

Participants are encouraged to:

- Develop and integrate solutions for big data processing and domain-specific Vietnamese data (language, audio, image).
- Use cutting-edge technologies such as **Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and enable **smart interaction between modules/systems**.

## 👩‍🎓 For Category B Contestants (High School Students)

- Students from both specialized and non-specialized high schools (Category B) are allowed to use pre-built tools provided by the organizers to complete the tasks.

## 📚 Training Support

- After registration, contestants will receive training on key knowledge and skills aligned with the competition themes.
